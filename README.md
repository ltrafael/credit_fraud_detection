# Credit Fraud Detection

Project developing machine learning solutions to detect fraudulent CNP transactions. The goal of this project is to apply ML techniques to predict fraud in credit card transactions. A comparison is also made between a traditional solution and one that takes into account concept drift in the data.

**Dataset information**:  
Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'.
- 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset
- 'Amount' is the transaction Amount
- Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise
